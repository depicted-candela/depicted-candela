# My energy

- 👋 Is a pleasure to say to you hello, my name is Nicolás Córdoba {@depicted-candela}, and I finished my undergraduate degree in Cadastral Engineering and Geodesy at the Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.
- 👀 I have a strong interest in Computer Science for productivity and memory tools, AI for creativity and memory enhacement; exploring, analyzing, and processing Spatial Data, and for the creation of GIS tools specially for Geodessy. Additionally, I am fascinated by the prospect of cloud-based web development, as it enables interoperable, concurrent and parallel systems.
- I have strong experience with TypeScript, Python, Java and C++.
- 🌱 I am embarking on a journey of pure Mathematics for Graph systems, Space Engineering and Physics, and development of big systems. My mid-term goals include incorporating strong skills in Graphs with advanced CS abstractions and paradigms.
- 💞️ Besides these codifications I feel passionate about philosophy, and poetry.
