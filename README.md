# My energy

- 👋 Is a pleasure to say to you hello, my name is Nicolás Córdoba {@depicted-candela}, and I finished my undergraduate degree in Cadastral Engineering and Geodesy at the Universidad Francisco José de Caldas.
- 👀 I have a strong interest in Computer Science for exploring, analyzing, and processing Spatial Data, and for the creation of GIS tools. Additionally, I am fascinated by the prospect of cloud-based web development, as it enables interoperable data sharing.
- I have strong experience with Python, Java, and JavaScript.
- 🌱 I am embarking on a journey of pure Mathematics for Space Engineering and Physics, and cloud-based web development. My mid-term goals include incorporating strong skills in idiomatic Python, and advanced abstractions and paradigms.
- 💞️ Besides these codifications I feel passionate about guitar interpretation, calisthenics, and philosophy.
- 📫 Shoot me an email if you want to chat!: {nicalcoca@gmail.com}
